# Snek: A Python Project

## Setting Up
### More work with Git
If you look on your local folder, the `snek` folder is almost empty! You will need to set up `upstream` and `pull`.

In your terminal, type the following:
```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/crimtech/crimtech-comp-f20.git
git pull upstream master
git push origin master
```

The second line updates your local folder with the updated version of this directory, and the third line pushes these changes to your own Github repository.

**Do not continue until you have finished this step.**
### Code Editor
As we start coding, a code editor is invaluable. It adds syntax highlighting, auto completion and other generally nice features.

We recommend [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), though Sublime Text also has a big following.

### Windows Users: Run this lab locally
`Snake` requires a video playback device. However, inside the WSL terminal we do not have that feature. One approach would be to install XServer, but it is a lot of hassle and debuggin for not a great result.

If you are running Windows, please install Python locally.

### `pip install pygame`
As the title says, please run `pip install pygame` to install the necessary module.

## Individual or Teamwork track?
Please sign up for the track you will do [here](https://forms.gle/EUF76mH1TamrbFkL8) by Wednesday, 9/23.
* Individual track is good for people who have coding experience and would rather work alone. You need to submit a working Snake game.
* Teamwork track is good either if you have less experience, or if you want to meet some new people. Your commitment: answers to the python tutorial, and 90 minutes of your time next week.
