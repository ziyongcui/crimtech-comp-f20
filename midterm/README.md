# Midterm Interview, Fall 2020
Hi everyone, welcome to the midterm interview! We are excited to speak with you about how you are doing and how you are finding the comp so far. In Crimson tradition, we will also be asking you a few questions about the Crimson as well as Crimson Tech.

The interview will be _open book_, meaning you can use any notes to help us answer the questions.

## Rough Structure
We would spend 3 minutes discussing how the comp: how is it going? What is the community like? What can we do to improve? Why are you comping the Crimson? How has the comp changed what you think about the Crimson?

Then, we would spend 3 minutes talking about life outside of the comp: how is your semester? What are you studying, and why those classes? What do you do outside of classes? What do you do for fun?

Finally, we will ask some questions chosen from below.

## General Questions
1. Who are your comp directors?
2. Who are the big three at the Crimson (president, managing editor, business manager)?
3. Who are the tech chairs at the Crimson?
4. Who is your mentor?
5. Name two other people from the Crimson tech board other than the names above.
6. Tell us about a project your mentor has worked on/is working on in the past year.
7. Tell us the names of 5 compers in the comp class.
